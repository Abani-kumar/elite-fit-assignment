# Answers to Technical Questions

## How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 8-10 hours on the coding test, broken down as follows:
- Initial setup and project configuration: .5 hour
- Core functionality implementation: 2-3 hours
- UI/UX design and implementation: 2-3 hours
- Testing and bug fixes: 1 hour
- Documentation: 1 hour

## What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language?

The React Compiler in React 19 stands out as the most useful feature, as it eliminates the need for manual performance optimizations and memoization. Here's a practical example demonstrating the difference:

Before React 19, developers had to manually optimize performance using `useCallback` and `useMemo`. For example:

```javascript
const TaskList = memo(({ tasks }) => {
  const filteredTasks = useMemo(() => tasks.filter(task => !task.completed), [tasks]);
  return <div>{filteredTasks.map(task => <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />)}</div>;
});
```

With React 19, the React Compiler automatically optimizes the code, making manual memoization unnecessary:

```javascript
const TaskList = ({ tasks }) => {
  const filteredTasks = tasks.filter(task => !task.completed);
  return <div>{filteredTasks.map(task => <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />)}</div>;
};
```

This feature reduces the need for explicit memoization, leading to cleaner code and improved performance.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production?

To track down performance issues in production, I would follow these steps:

### 1. Monitoring and Data Collection
- Use performance monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog
- Analyze React DevTools performance profiler data
- Review Chrome DevTools performance timeline
- Check network waterfall charts for bottlenecks

### 2. Common Areas to Investigate
- Component re-render frequency
- Network request timing
- Bundle size and code splitting
- Memory leaks
- Browser storage operations

### 3. Real-World Example
In my experience, I once dealt with a performance issue where a task list was rendering slowly in production. The investigation revealed unnecessary re-renders due to improper use of `React.memo` and deep object comparisons. I resolved it by:

1. Implementing proper memoization
2. Optimizing the state structure
3. Adding performance monitoring using React DevTools
4. Setting up automated performance testing

## If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding?

### 1. Technical Improvements
- Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens

### 2. Feature Enhancements
- Task categorization with tags
- Drag-and-drop task reordering
- Task recurrence options
- Subtasks and task dependencies
- Export/import task data
- Task statistics and progress tracking
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Task sharing capabilities
- Dark mode support

### 3. User Experience
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add task completion animations
- Improve accessibility features
- Add proper form validation
- Implement proper loading states
